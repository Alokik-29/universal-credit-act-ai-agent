            "\n",
            "• **Purpose**: The Act makes provision to alter the rates of the standard allowance, limited capability for work element, and limited capability for work and work-related activity element of universal credit and the rates of income-related employment and support allowance.\n",
            "\n",
            "• **Key definitions**:\n",
            "  - \"Standard allowance\" refers to the allowance included in an award of universal credit.\n",
            "  - \"Limited capability for work element\" (LCW element) and \"limited capability for work and work-related activity element\" (LCWRA element) are specific elements of universal credit.\n",
            "  - \"Pre-2026 claimant\" and \"severe conditions criteria claimant\" are new claimant categories introduced in the Act.\n",
            "\n",
            "• **Eligibility rules**: The Act introduces new eligibility rules for the LCWRA element, including a \"pre-2026 claimant\" category, which refers to claimants who were entitled to an award of universal credit before April 6, 2026.\n",
            "\n",
            "• **Obligations of authorities**: The Secretary of State and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland must exercise relevant powers to secure that the amounts of the standard allowance and LCWRA element are at least the minimum amounts calculated for each tax year.\n",
            "\n",
            "• **Payment calculations**: The minimum amounts of the standard allowance for each tax year are calculated by increasing the amounts of the standard allowance for the previous tax year by the relevant CPI percentage and the relevant uplift percentage.\n",
            "\n",
            "• **Enforcement elements**: The Act provides that the annual up-rating of benefits under section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 does not apply to the standard allowance and certain elements of universal credit and income-related employment and support allowance for the tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30.\n",
            "\n",
            "• **Protected LCWRA amount**: The Secretary of State and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland must increase the protected LCWRA amount for each tax year to ensure that the sum of the protected LCWRA amount and the standard allowance for each combination of claimants is at least the amount given by increasing the sum of those amounts for the previous tax year by the relevant CPI percentage.\n",
            "\n",
            "• **Legacy employment and support allowance**: The Act applies the provisions of the Act to the amounts of the ESA IR personal allowance for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, as well as to the severe disability premium and enhanced disability premium specified in the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008.\n",
            "\n",
            "• **Corresponding provision for Northern Ireland**: Schedule 2 makes provision for Northern Ireland that corresponds to the provisions of the Act.\n"

Regulation 40A defines a 'severe conditions criteria claimant' with lifelong conditions assessed under Schedule 7. Regulation 27A defines a 'pre-2026 claimant' as one who was entitled to an award of universal credit that included the LCWRA element at any time before 6 April 2026 and has been continuously entitled to an award of universal credit that included the LCWRA element since then. Regulation 40A defines a 'severe conditions criteria claimant' as one who has limited capability for work and work-related activity on the basis of an assessment under this Part and at least one of the descriptors set out in Schedule 7 constantly applies to the claimant and will do so for the rest of the claimant's life. Section 1 outlines the procedure for calculating the minimum amounts of the standard allowance for a tax year. Section 2 outlines the LCWRA element for tax year 2026-27. Section 3 Freezes the LCWRA and LCW elements for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30. Section 4 outlines the procedure for increasing the protected LCWRA amount for a tax year. Section 5 applies the same procedure to legacy employment and support allowance payments. Schedule 1 makes amendments to the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 in connection with new amounts of the LCWRA element. Regulations 27A and 40A are new and define the 'pre-2026 claimant' and 'severe conditions criteria claimant' respectively.\",\n",
